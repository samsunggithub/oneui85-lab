<p align="center"><strong>Star7-ROM</strong> is a work-in-progress One UI porting project for Samsung Galaxy Note series devices.</p>

## Project scope

Star7-ROM uses the [UN1CA](https://github.com/salvogiangri/UN1CA) build system as its project and build-framework foundation. UN1CA supplies the firmware acquisition, extraction, patch-application, and flashable-package workflow used by this branch. This laboratory branch uses the Galaxy S24 FE source-firmware configuration (`SM-S721B/EUX`) as its current One UI 8.5 base.

## Upstream lineage and porting references

The current Galaxy Note10+ porting work in this branch primarily derives from the device-focused project lineage, target-side configuration references, patch organization, and porting experience of [EternityROM fifteen][2] and [ExtremeROM fifteen][3]. UN1CA remains the build-system base, while these two projects are the principal references for the Exynos Note10+ adaptation itself.

| Project | Role in this branch |
|---|---|
| [UN1CA][1] | Parent build system and firmware-to-package workflow. |
| [EternityROM fifteen][2] | Primary Galaxy Note10-series (Exynos) porting reference, including target-device configuration and patching approach. |
| [ExtremeROM fifteen][3] | Historical project foundation and major reference for the porting structure, device adaptation practices, and upstream project lineage. |

> **Attribution notice:** these projects are credited as upstream references for this branch. Their respective authors, licenses, and repository terms remain applicable; this attribution does not imply endorsement or active maintenance by their maintainers.

The project direction covers the Samsung Galaxy Note family. Device support is introduced and validated target by target; a roadmap entry is not a compatibility guarantee.

## Current build targets

The `main` branch currently contains configurations and build-matrix entries for the following Exynos Galaxy Note10+ models.

| Device | Codename | Verified model |
|---|---|---|
| Galaxy Note10+ (Exynos) | `d2s` | `SM-N975F` |
| Galaxy Note10+ 5G (Exynos) | `d2xks` | `SM-N976N` |

## Support roadmap

Additional Galaxy Note-series devices will be introduced progressively after their target configuration, partition layout, firmware compatibility, and device-specific patches have been implemented and validated.

> **Current status:** only the two Note10+ targets listed above are configured in this branch. Do not flash a package on a model that is not explicitly listed in the target table or release notes.

## Porting and build approach

Star7-ROM keeps the target-device contract explicit. The build process combines the configured source firmware with target-specific integration for device properties, partition handling, display configuration, framework and application patches, CSC behavior, Bluetooth compatibility, and packaged blobs. For `d2xks`, the static-partition contract and 60 Hz target profile are retained.

## Features and integration

The exact feature set depends on the selected target and source firmware. Where supported by the active device configuration and patches, the project includes:

- Samsung One UI porting through the UN1CA build pipeline.
- Target-specific framework, application, CSC, and compatibility patches.
- Device-aware display and partition handling.
- Bluetooth library compatibility integration.
- AppLock, Knox-related, signature, settings, and system-behavior patches where applicable.
- Flashable release packages generated for the selected target.

# Target configuration and kernel sources

Target-specific configuration is maintained in [`target/d2s`](target/d2s) and [`target/d2xks`](target/d2xks). Kernel and device-tree source references must be selected for the exact target and release being built; the repository does not claim a single shared kernel source for all planned Galaxy Note-series devices.
